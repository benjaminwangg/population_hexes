Parquet is a popular, open-source, column-oriented file format designed for efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets, especially in big data environments.  
.GPKGs are converted to .parquets for faster opening and querying times.  Each row represents a hex with the following schema
- h3: Hex identifier
- population: Population count
- density_per_mi2: Population density per square mile
- city: City name (reverse-geocoded data)
- county: County name
- state: State name
- centroid: Centroid coordinates
- geometry: Hex geometry
* - minsignal for broadband coverage by provider

State-specific level.
